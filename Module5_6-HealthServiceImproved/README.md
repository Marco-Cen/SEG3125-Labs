* (Lab 5-6, Module 5/6 Site): <br>
https://marco-cen.github.io/SEG3125-Labs/Module5_6-HealthServiceImproved/

<br>

# Objective:
- Keep in mind:
    - Include design principles presented in book: Design of Everyday Things by Dr. Norman.
    - Cognitive load requested by site (Human Cognition)
    - use of icons 
- Learn JavaScript framework, jQuery to create responsive site

<br> <br>

## Functional Requirements:
1) Choose serivce and a date and allow user to choose expert/professional of their choice
2) Guarantee Service Reservation: user must provide CC info (Add payment section to site)

## Human Cognition Requirements:
1) Attention (User knows where they are)
    - Menu options that bring user to right place on page (Not new pages)
2) Memory (Avoid menus too long: if 10 types of services, organize into sub-groups)
3) Perception (Review Law of Gestalt)
    - Law of Similarity: similar elements to see as a group (Colours, icons, etc.)
    - Law of Figure and Ground: Clear visible icons on various bkg colours?
    - Law of Focal Point: Users attention focused (Ex: Navbar menu to know where users are)

## Visual Communication Tools (Icons)
    - Must add icons on page for: (Visible on various bkgs)
        - Services 
        - Experts/Professionals
        - Payment
        - 2 other elements of your choice

## Design Principles (From book: Design of Everyday Things by Dr. Norman)
    - Previous Lab: Visibility & Consistency
    - Now, Feedback and Constraints

        - Visibility and Affordance: (See can do and understand)
            - Help user understand info to enter (Use tooltips: eg hover over description box)
            - Highlight of entries (Eg: on hover over, change colour of entry or emphasize entry in another way)

        - Constraints: (only acceptable choices and enter allowed info)
            - validation of inputs (Ex: Telephone or CC #)
            - Hide unavailable dates on date select (Dependant on professional selected!)

        - User Feedback:
            - Input errors (Give error msgs)
            - Any other feedback necessary to help user understand what happeneded

        - Consistency:
            - Choice of jQuery UI theme related to site overall (Uniform jQuery themes)
            - Choice of icons related to theme (Icons styling is same)
